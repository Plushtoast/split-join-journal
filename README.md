Foundry VTT v10 introduced the new Journals V2.  This module lets you manage pages and Journals, merging and organizing them simply.

With this module you can:
1. Split a single Journal Page based on HTML headings into separate pages, either in the same Journal or in a separate Journal.
2. Split all of the pages in a Journal into separate Journals (one page per journal), either in a new folder or in the existing folder.
3. Join all of the Journals (and all of their pages) within a single folder into a new single Journal, with all of the pages from all of the Journals.

This module was inspired by the module "Split Journal", which worked with the old V1 journals.
